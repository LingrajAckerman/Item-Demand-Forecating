# Item-Demand-Forecating
Demand forecasting is the process of predicting what the demand for certain products will be in the future. This helps manufacturers to decide what they should produce and guides retailers toward what they should stock.

Demand forecasting is aimed at improving the processes of Supplier relationship management, Customer relationship management, Order fulfillment and logistics and Marketing campaigns.

Here I have created a 3-month demand forecasting model for the relevant retailer using the time series and machine learning techniques.
The data set includes 5 years of data for 10 different stores and 50 different products of a chain of stores between 2013–01–01 and 2017–12–31.
